‚òïCoffee Sales Dashboard ‚Äì Excel Project

üìå About the Project
This Excel project analyses sales data for coffee in a number of product categories and geographical areas. Building an interactive dashboard that shows product performance, identifies best-selling products, and allows for regional comparison was the aim.

In an intuitive visual style, the dashboard lets users sort data by product type and area, learn which products are driving sales, and identify which categories might require attention.
